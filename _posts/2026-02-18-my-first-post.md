I recently took up a subscription to [Mubi](https://mubi.com/en/gb) and had the semi-enjoyable experience of watching Wim's latest feature film "Perfect Days".

I'll qualify my usage of 'semi-' momentarily.

But first, what struck me about this film is that - perhaps somewhat in line with Wenders' recent declaration that filmmakers ought to ["steer clear of politics"](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/feb/17/javier-bardem-and-tilda-swinton-among-those-to-condemn-berlinales-silence-on-gaza) - this film attempts to be intensely apolitical about a man who is supposedly 'content with his lot'.

I couldn't quite work out whether I was meant to feel sorry for this man, aspire to this man or perhaps
question how he *really* felt about everything underneath the surface.
