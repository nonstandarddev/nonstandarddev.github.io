I recently took up a subscription to [Mubi](https://mubi.com/en/gb) and had the semi-enjoyable 
experience of watching Wim Wender's latest feature film "Perfect Days" (2023).

If you don't know who Wim Wenders is, in recent days he implored his fellow filmmakers to 
["steer clear of politics"](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/feb/17/javier-bardem-and-tilda-swinton-among-those-to-condemn-berlinales-silence-on-gaza). 
This is the same man who - ironically enough - once said the following,

> Every film is political. Most political of all are those that pretend not to be: 'entertainment' 
> movies. They are the most political films there are because they dismiss the possibility of change. 
> In every frame they tell you everything's fine the way it is. They are a continual advertisement 
> for things as they are.

There's a confusing subtext to "Perfect Days" in my view. On the surface, it is a film about a 
minimum wage service worker who nonetheless appears to be 'content with his lot'. But despite the 
obvious class dynamics at play, the film tries to focus on the virtues of 'having a routine' or 
'looking at shadows cast upon the wall' or 'sticking on a classic Van Morrison record on 
the way to work'. 

Whilst I am a great fan of appreciating the little things, I did wonder as I watched this 
film what the average minimum wage worker thought of this slightly idealised depiction of what life 
is like at the bottom. My question at the beginning of the film remained the same by the end: is 
Hiroyama (our protagonist) putting on a brave face or is he *genuinely* happy with his lot?

I noted one critic state that "Karl Marx never quite understood the elation of listening to a good 
Beatles album on the way to work". That is true. But he *did* understand the alienation human beings 
suffered from when subjected to the same mind-numbingly menial work over and over again for years 
to come.

**Overall Score:** 3.5 / 5
