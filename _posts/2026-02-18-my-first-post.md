I recently took up a subscription to [Mubi](https://mubi.com/en/gb) and had the semi-enjoyable experience of watching Wim Wender's latest feature film "Perfect Days" (2023).

If you don't know who Wim Wenders is, in recent days he implored his fellow filmmakers to ["steer clear of politics"](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/feb/17/javier-bardem-and-tilda-swinton-among-those-to-condemn-berlinales-silence-on-gaza). This is the same man who - ironically enough - once said the following,

> Every film is political. Most political of all are those that pretend not to be: 'entertainment' movies. They are the most political films there are because they dismiss the possibility of change. In every frame they tell you everything's fine the way it is. They are a continual advertisement for things as they are.

His (hypocritical) stance sort of made his feature "Perfect Days" make a little more sense to me. On the surface, it is a film about a minimum wage service worker who nonetheless appears to be 'content with his lot'. But despite the obvious class dynamics at play, the film does everything in its will to be intensely *apolitical* and instead tries to focus on the 'virtues'
of 'having a routine' or 'looking at shadows cast upon the wall in front of you' or 'sticking on
a classic Van Morrison record on the way to work'. You get the idea - live in the moment, be free *dude*.

I did wonder as I watched this film what the average minimum wage worker thought of this slightly
idealised depiction of what life is like at the bottom. To be clear, I am a great fan of the idea that
human beings ought to be living a more 'present' lifestyle. But my question at the beginning of the film
remained the same by the end: is Hiroyama (our protagonist) putting on a brave face or is he genuinely 
happy to be here?

I noted one critic say "Karl Marx never quite understood the elation of listening to a good Beatles
album on the way to work". That is true. But he *did* understand the alienation human beings suffer when subjected
to the same mind-numbingly menial work over and over again for years to come.

So, are these "Perfect Days" then, or "Imperfect Days"? Which one is it? And where are we today?
