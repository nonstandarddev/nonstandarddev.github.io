I recently took up a subscription to [Mubi](https://mubi.com/en/gb) and had the semi-enjoyable experience of watching Wim Wender's latest feature film "Perfect Days" (2023).

Yes, this is the same man that in recent days implored his fellow filmmakers to ["steer clear of politics"](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/feb/17/javier-bardem-and-tilda-swinton-among-those-to-condemn-berlinales-silence-on-gaza).

Ironic, then, that this film (about a minimum wage service worker who nonetheless appears to be 'content with his lot') does everything in its will to be intensely *apolitical* and instead tries to focus on the 'virtues'
of 'having a routine', 'looking at shadows cast upon the wall in front of you' or 'sticking on
a classic Van Morrison record on the way to work'.

I did wonder as I watched this film what the average minimum wage worker thought of this slightly
idealised depiction of what life is like at the bottom. To be clear, I am a big fan of the idea that
human beings ought to be living a more 'present' lifestyle. But my question at the beginning of the film
remained the same by the end: is Hiroyama (our protagonist) putting on a brave face or is he genuinely 
happy to be here?

I noted one critic say "Karl Marx never quite understood the elation of listening to a good Beatles
album on the way to work". That is true. But he *did* understand the alienation human beings suffer when subjected
to the same mind-numbingly menial work over and over again for years to come.

"Perfect Days" then, or "Imperfect Days"? Which one is it? And where are we today?
